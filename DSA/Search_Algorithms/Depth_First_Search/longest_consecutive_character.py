"""
Given an M Ã— N matrix of characters, find the length of the longest path in the matrix starting from a given character. All characters in the longest path should be increasing and consecutive to each other in alphabetical order.

We are allowed to search the string in all eight possible directions, i.e., North, West, South, East, North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West.


For example, consider the following matrix of characters:

# define directions
row = [-1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
col = [-1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 1]
