"""
Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when
everyone is available.

To do this, youâ€™ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as an object of a
Meeting class with integer variables startTime and endTime. These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.
